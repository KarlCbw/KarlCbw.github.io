I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Northeastern University(NEU). I have been a research student in [AI4CE LAB](https://ai4ce.github.io/) at New York University(NYU), working with [Dr.Sihang Li](https://louis-leee.github.io/), advised by [Prof.Chen Feng](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/chen-feng).

My research interest lies in the intersection of robotics and computer vision, focusing on enabling intelligent agents to accurately perceive their surrounding environment.
